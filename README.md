# DraftPredictionGrader
Users submit a draft prediction. These are put into an XL sheet. The correct answers have a title of 'results'. Output logs to the console. 
Grades like this: 
-correct team is 10 points
-0 to 15 spots off for the draft spot is that amount of points (1 spot off is 14 points, 2 spots off is 13 pts, etc.)
-16-30 spots off is 0 points.
-31+ spots if negative points. Ex: 31 is -1, 32 is -2, etc.
